NotinLite is a lightweight, minimalistic note-taking / reminder / notification system (or whatever “Notin” stands for in your context). It’s designed to be fast, clean, and easy to integrate or embed into existing solutions.

Key goals:

Keep dependencies minimal and the footprint small

Provide core features for note or notification management

Be easy to deploy, maintain, and extend

It can serve as a backend service (API), a desktop tool, or a library depending on its implementation.
